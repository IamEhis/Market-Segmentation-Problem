# Market-Segmentation-Problem
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive customer segmentation strategy for XYZ Sports Company. By analyzing data from the company's ERP system, we aim to identify distinct customer segments, understand their characteristics, and provide tailored marketing strategies to enhance customer engagement and optimize business efforts.
Finding new customers is vital in every industry. The process for finding new customers begins by learning as much as possible from the existing customers. Understanding current customers allows organizations to identify groups of customers that have different product interests, market participation, or responses to marketing efforts. This knowledge enables better customer service and improved targeting of prospective customers.

Market segmentation, the process of identifying customer groups, makes use of geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral characteristics of customers. By understanding the differences between these segments, organizations can make better strategic choices about opportunities, product definition, positioning, promotions, pricing, and target marketing.
